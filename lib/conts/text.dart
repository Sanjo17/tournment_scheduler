  final String singleIntro ='''A single elimination tournament, also known as a knockout tournament, is a type of competition where participants are eliminated after losing a single game or match. In this type of tournament, the winner of each match advances to the next round while the loser is eliminated from the competition. The tournament continues in this fashion until there is only one player or team remaining, who is declared the winner of the tournament.
                  
                  Single elimination tournaments are commonly used in a variety of sports, such as tennis, basketball, and soccer. They are also used in other types of competitions, such as video game tournaments and academic competitions.
                  
                  One of the advantages of a single elimination tournament is that it is relatively easy to organize and manage, as there are no complicated schedules or multiple rounds to coordinate. However, one of the disadvantages is that it can be less fair than other types of tournaments, as a single loss can knock out a strong team or player who may have gone on to win in a double elimination or round-robin format.
                  
                  Overall, single elimination tournaments can be exciting and intense, with high stakes and a sense of urgency for participants.''';

  final String doubleIntro = '''A double elimination tournament is a type of competition where participants have to lose two games or matches in order to be eliminated from the competition. In this type of tournament, each participant has two chances to stay in the tournament: if they lose one match, they are placed in a loser's bracket and have to win their next match to stay in the competition. If they lose again, they are eliminated from the tournament.
                  
                  Double elimination tournaments are commonly used in a variety of sports, such as baseball, softball, and pool, as well as in video game competitions and academic competitions. They are often seen as a fairer alternative to single elimination tournaments, as participants have more than one chance to prove themselves and a single loss does not automatically eliminate them from the competition.
                  
                  One advantage of a double elimination tournament is that it can be more fair than a single elimination tournament, as participants have a second chance to advance in the competition. However, one disadvantage is that it can be more complicated to organize and manage, as there are multiple rounds and schedules to coordinate.
                  
                  Overall, double elimination tournaments can be exciting and intense, with high stakes and a sense of urgency for participants, while also providing a fairer and more balanced competition format.''';
  final String roundIntro = '''A round-robin tournament is a type of competition where each participant plays against every other participant in the tournament. In this type of tournament, each participant plays the same number of matches, and the winner is determined based on the total number of wins and losses or points earned throughout the tournament.
                  
                  Round-robin tournaments are commonly used in a variety of sports, such as soccer, tennis, and golf, as well as in other types of competitions, such as academic competitions. They are often seen as a fairer alternative to single elimination tournaments, as every participant has an equal chance to play against every other participant and prove themselves.
                  
                  One advantage of a round-robin tournament is that it provides a more complete and balanced view of each participant's performance, as they have to play against every other participant in the tournament. It also reduces the impact of luck and chance, as a single loss does not necessarily eliminate a participant from the competition. However, one disadvantage is that it can be more time-consuming and difficult to organize, as each participant has to play multiple matches.
                  
                  Overall, round-robin tournaments can provide a fair and balanced competition format that allows every participant to showcase their skills and abilities. They can also be exciting and intense, with participants competing against each other multiple times throughout the tournament.''';
